## Overview
### Description
A Tinder-like app that allows dog owners to find a playmate for their dogs.

### App Evaluation
[Evaluation of your app across the following attributes]
- **Category:** Social Networking
- **Mobile:** This app will be primarily developed for mobile but would function on a computer as well. Mobile version for this application would be more friendly to use and allows for more features.
- **Story:** Dog owners are able to connect and match with other dog owners and potentially set up a puppy playdate.
- **Market:** Dog owners will typically be using this app.
- **Habit:** This app will be used in the event a dog owner is looking for nearby companions for their furry friend. Could be often and also unoften.
- **Scope:** We hope to start off with a basic Tinder replica and apply some unique matching features into the app.
